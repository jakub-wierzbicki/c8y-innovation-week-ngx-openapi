 *
 * For each tenant, Cumulocity IoT manages the subscribed applications and provides a number of applications of various types.
 * In case you want to subscribe a tenant to an application using an API, you must use the application name in the argument (as name).
 *
 * Refer to the tables in [Administration > Managing applications](https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/administration#managing-applications) in the *User guide* for the respective application name to be used.
 *
 * > **&#9432; Info:** The Accept header should be provided in all POST/PUT requests, otherwise an empty response body will be returned.
